Game-based learning environments are intended to give students a productive and entertaining learning experience. Predictive student models forecast student results using data collected through students' in-game learning behaviors. 
The main idea is to develop a machine learning framework, to predict student performance during game-based learning. 
The dataset used for training the model is one of the largest open datasets of game logs, providing a wealth of information to train and test the model's performance.
